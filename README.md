# Heart-Failure-Predictor
Logistic Regression on 11 clinical features for predicting heart disease events.

OBJECTIVE:

The main objective of this work is to predict if a patient is at risk of having heart disease or not, based on the common features of patients with heart disease.

DATA USED:

This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets with a total of 918 observations are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The features are as the following:

Age: age of the patient [years]

Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]

ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]

RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]

MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]

ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]

Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]

ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]

TARGET:

HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
